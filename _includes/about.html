                <h2>ScalABM</h2>
                <p>The aggregate behavior of many economic systems fundamentally depends on system size. In order to accurately model the dynamics of real economies we need to build and simulate models that are as close to observed system scale as possible.</p> 

                <p>Progress in building large scale ABMs of economic systems has been significantly hindered by the lack of a common modeling platform, lack of a common tool stack for data management and analytics, and lack of access to model source code.</p>
                
                <p>ScalABM is a <em>community driven</em>, <em>open-source</em> project to develop a <em>user-friendly</em> modeling platform and tool stack for building <em>scalable</em>, <em>data-driven</em>, and <em>reproducible</em> agent-based models (ABMs) of <em>economic</em> systems on the JVM using <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a>.</p>
